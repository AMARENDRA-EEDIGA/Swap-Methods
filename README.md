// Swapping best algorithms
1..*=== if a and b are the two variables we need to swap their values without third variable ===*
----
a = b-a;
b = b-a;
a = b+a;

2.. *=== By using third variable we can swap easyly ===*
----
let's take an empty variable is called temp
temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;

3.. Interchanging the elements Like
Here a and b are swapping with each other
a, b = b, a;

4.. *=== Finally we can also swap them by using binary number system. ===*
